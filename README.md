# Face-mask-detection
COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly affected our day-to-day life disrupting the world trade and movements. Wearing a protective face mask has become a new normal. In the near future, many public service providers will ask the customers to wear masks correctly to avail of their services. Therefore, face mask detection has become a crucial task to help global society. This paper presents a simplified approach to achieve this purpose using some basic Machine Learning packages like pillow, OpenCV and imgutils. The proposed method detects the face from the image correctly and then identifies if it has a mask on it or not.
